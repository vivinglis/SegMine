    "I struggled a bit with installing the dependencies for Cellpose, and spent far too long trying to install the gui, but eventually succeeded after a hefty amount of googling, lots of StackOverflow, and a bit of ChatGPT help. Also I had tried to install DeepProfile prior to Cellpose, but found out that they require different versions of certain packages, so had to uninstall and start again. All this on an internet speed of roughly 8Mbps down since I wasn't at home on Saturday. Luckily, I returned that evening to a glorious ~200Mbps down and finally managed to download the image data files."
